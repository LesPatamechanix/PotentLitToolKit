# PotentLitToolKit


Java based desktop toolkit for generating OULIPO inspired writing.

In addition to this a number of patadata based categories are supported including:

1. Clinamen
2. Syzygy
3. Antonym
4. Equivelant

Patadata taxonomy can be found included with the source code in YAML format.


## Oulipan Constraints

Some Oulipian constraints (taken from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo) for future inclusion:

### S+7, sometimes called N+7 
Replace every noun in a text with the seventh noun after it in a dictionary. For example, "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago..." becomes "Call me islander. Some yeggs ago...". Results will vary depending upon the dictionary used. This technique can also be performed on other lexical classes, such as verbs.

### Snowball 
A poem in which each line is a single word, and each successive word is one letter longer.
Lipogram 
Writing that excludes one or more letters. The previous sentence is a lipogram in B, F, J, K, Q, V, Y, and Z (it does not contain any of those letters).

### Prisoner's constraint, also called Macao constraint 
A type of lipogram that omits letters with ascenders and descenders (b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, q, t, and y).
Palindromes
Sonnets and other poems constructed using palindromic techniques.

### Univocalism
A poem using only one vowel letter. In English and some other languages the same vowel letter can represent different sounds, which means that e.g. "born" and "cot" could both be used in a univocalism. Words with the same vowel sound, represented by different vowel letters in English, could not be used - e.g. "blue" and "stew".
